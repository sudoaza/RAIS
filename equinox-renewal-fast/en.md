## A Modern Secular Ritual for 2024

In our fast-paced modern world, finding moments for reflection, connection, and personal growth is more important than ever. This year, we're excited to introduce a new secular fasting ritual designed to bring individuals and communities together in a meaningful way: the Equinox Renewal Fast. Aligning with the natural cycles of the earth, this ritual is centered around the equinoxes â€” times of balance when day and night are equal, heralding the change of seasons.

## What is the Equinox Renewal Fast?

Spanning 7 days around each equinox, this ritual encourages mindfulness, community connection, and gratitude. It incorporates light fasting from sunrise to sunset with a focus on hydration and minimal nourishment. Each evening culminates in a communal meal that emphasizes the simplicity and nutrition of whole foods.

## Equinox Dates for 2024

- **March Equinox**: March 17th - March 23rd
- **September Equinox**: September 20th - September 26th

## Core Practices

- **Daytime**: Light fasting with water, herbal teas, and clear broths.
- **Evening Meal**: Nutritious, simple meals prepared from seasonal, locally sourced foods, shared mindfully.

## Values of the Fast

- **Mindfulness**: Encouraging reflection and a deeper connection to our internal and external environments.
- **Community**: Strengthening ties through shared experiences and meals.
- **Sustainability**: Promoting gratitude for the earth's bounty by prioritizing seasonal, locally sourced foods, aligning with sustainable living practices.

## Supportive Activities

Participants are encouraged to engage in digital detox, reflective journaling, meditation, and nature walks, enhancing the experience of renewal and connection. Community gatherings, either in person or virtually, provide additional support and deepen the sense of collective journey.
